#Background Information 


Classification is a supervised learning task. Supervised learning algorithms are organised into a taxonomy based on the desired outcome of the algorithm. Thus, generating a function that maps inputs to desired outputs.  During classification, features related to a set of example observations can be used to train a decision function that generates class assignments (labels) with a given accuracy. 

The supervised machine learning algorithms which deal more with classification are Linear Classifiers, Perceptron, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Quadratic Classifiers, K-Means Clustering, Boosting, Decision Trees, Random Forest (RF), Neural Networks, Bayesian Networks and many more.For the classification outcome to be successful, the training sample data  needs to be a sufficient number. 


#Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning algorithm is known for its ability to learn data classification patterns with balanced accuracy and reproducibility. It can also be used to perform regression tasks. However, in this case, it will be used for a classification task.  

Classification problems are most often linear, the hyperplane used is straight and not curved (linear classifier). However, in more complex classification problems, the optimal solutions may require outright curved hyperplanes (non-linear classifiers). Thus, Kernel methods are often used as a form of dimensionality for linear SVM 

Is known for its relative simplicity and flexibility in addressing a range of classification problems. 

There are three stages to SVM analysis. 

1.	Feature selection 
2.	Training and testing the classifier.
3.	Performance evaluation
   

#Decision Tree (DT)

Decision Tree is known for its ability to change complicated decision-making problems into simple processes. Finding solutions, which is easier to represent and understand. 


#Summary of the code result 

In comparison to other classifiers, SVM is known for its ability to achieve balanced performance (high accuracy), where the sample size is much smaller relative to the dimensionality of the feature space. It is well suited for addressing a range of classification problems such as the diagnosis of prognosis of brain diseases such as AD, schizophrenia, and depression.  

The result indicates the SVM classifier outperformed the Decision Tree classifier. The Decision Tree classifier scored slightly lower than SVM. 

However, this alone is not enough to make a comparison, other factors such number of sample data, computational resources, stability of the algorithm, and robustness to noise in the training data also need to be taken into consideration.
